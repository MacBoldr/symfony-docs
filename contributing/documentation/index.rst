Contributing Documentation
==========================

Documentation is as important as code for Open Source projects. That's why
Symfony dedicates a great amount of resources to document new features and to
keep the rest of the documentation up-to-date.

More than 1,000 developers all around the world have contributed to Symfony
documentation and we are glad that you are considering joining this big family.
This guide will explain everything you need to contribute to the documentation:

* :doc:`The Contribution Process </contributing/documentation/overview>`,
  explains in detail the steps to follow to contribute fixes and new contents.
  It follows the standard GitHub contribution process of most Open Source
  projects, so you may already know everything that is needed.

* :doc:`Formats </contributing/documentation/format>`, explains the technical
  details of the reStructuredText format used to write the docs. Skip it if
  you already are familiar with this format.

* :doc:`Standards </contributing/documentation/standards>`, explains how to
  write docs and code examples to match the style and tone of the rest of the
  documentation.

* :doc:`License </contributing/documentation/license>`, explains the details of
  the Creative Commons BB-SA 3.0 license used by Symfony Documentation.
