Contributing Documentation
==========================

Documentation is as important as code for Open Source projects. That's why
Symfony dedicates a great amount of resources to document new features and to
keep the rest of the documentation up-to-date.

More than 1,000 developers have contributed to Symfony documentation and we are
glad that you are considering joining this big family. This guide will explain
everything you need to contribute to the documentation:

:doc:`The Contribution Process </contributing/documentation/overview>`
  Explains the steps to follow to contribute fixes and new contents. It follows
  the standard GitHub contribution process of most Open Source projects, so you
  may already know everything that is needed.

:doc:`Documentation Formats </contributing/documentation/format>`
  Explains the technical details of the reStructuredText format used to write
  the docs. Skip it if you already are familiar with this format.

:doc:`Documentation Standards </contributing/documentation/standards>`
  Explains how to write docs and code examples to match the style and tone of
  the rest of the documentation.

:doc:`License </contributing/documentation/license>`
  Explains the details of the Creative Commons BB-SA 3.0 license used by the
  Symfony Documentation.
